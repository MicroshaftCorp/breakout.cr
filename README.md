Breakout game written in crystal using [crsfml](https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml).

## Installation & Development

To run the game you will have to compile it yourself.
Before that you have to install crsfml as described [here](https://github.com/oprypin/crsfml#installation).
Then you should be able to compile it like any other crystal project.

## Usage

Please make sure that you run the game from the repository root e.g.: `./bin/breakout` or else it won't find the `resources` directory. Optionally you can put the executable next to the `resources` directory and run it from there.
